# MTCS-104-Digital-Image-Processing
This repository contains the labworks, assignments and tests I have taken as part of my elective in image processing.

As part of a seminar component, I selected a paper titled "Color Balance and Fusion for Underwater Image Enhancement" and as an assignment I had implemented it. I had not strictly followed the procedure in the paper. As you can see I used histogram equalization instead of whitebalancing and still got similar results. The paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8058463).
